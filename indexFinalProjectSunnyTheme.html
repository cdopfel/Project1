               Day Tripping To Cape Cod</h3>
            <p>
                Many of us underestimate the fun of a day trip.  You choose a destination,   
                wake up early and set off for a peaceful drive.  The change of scenery and
                mindset is healthy and the experience is rejuvenating. <a href="lifestyle/journal.htm">

            <!-- 1. in the sidebar we have a 200x160 image. we want to build a slideshow around this image
            2. put a 'div' around it with a id = photoshow.  Include 4 images.  Change the alt to 'photo galler'
            3. Make sure that each image is clickable so that they go to the 'photos homepage' of the 
            'lifestyle section'. bigger image. add the links around each image: <a href="lifesytle/photos.htm">
            4. define some .css that will help build the photo rotator.
            this will position the images so that they are underneath one another. and z-index info so the images 
            bubble up. go to the sidebar section in the css.
            5.  Wrap each link and image 'inside' of a separate div because these divs 
            will be hiding and showing
            5. then write the rotation code up in the scripts-->

            <p>
                Serenity in our world ? A place where there is an absolute change of your 
                mindset ? Turn the dial to calm.  Don't make excuses not to do this
                for yourself and for those who mean the most to you.  Time keeps ticking
                off and when you leave it all behind for 24 hours it will all still
                be waiting for you the next day.  Switch gears and physically
                go someplace else.  Realistically - only good from comes from your
                decision.
            </p>
            <p>You can: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>watch the sun rise over the ocean</li>
                <li>walk along the shore</li>
                <li>collect shells and stones</li>
                <li>lay on the soft sand and listen to the surf</li>
                <li>feel the sea mist and the warmth of the ocean sun</li>
                <li>meditate on the waves rolling in and rolling out</li>
                <li>meditate on the bobbing seals and sea otters</li>
                <li>surf or swim or watch others surf and swim</li>
                <li>stay late on the beach to watch a sky full of stars appear</li>
              
            </ul>

            <p>Do you consider what you cannot see ?  Millenia ago, people believed in what they could not see. 
                They felt the influence of nature, possibly spirits, God, bad juju or good juju.  But in our
                world today - we are affected by 'waves'.  Not those wonderful ?? waves that many of use meditate 
                upon at the ocean - but electromagnetic waves from all of our devices, sound waves etc. etc.
